"""The library page's sections (app/Madeira/Library.swift and SteamGames.swift), on the host.

Source checks that the library page is laid out as the fork's sectioned library:
Steam (the games being downloaded and the games Steam installed, collapsed by the
title), its Not installed group (folding on its own), then Other games (the
games you added, with Add a game); one grid without the Steam section; the
texts; the collapse switch MADEIRA_LIBRARY_COLLAPSE and the remembered states;
search and layout apply to every section; pull to refresh; the log line.
The rules behind the groups and the sort are compiled and run by
check-steam-games.py.
