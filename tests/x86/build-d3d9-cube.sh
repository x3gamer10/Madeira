# Build the 32-bit D3D9 acceptance test, d3d9-cube-x86.exe (docs/WOW64.md).
#
# Kept separate from build.sh on purpose: build.sh is owned by the 32-bit
# bring-up track (hello-x86 / window-x86) and this stage only adds files.
#
# Usage: ./build-d3d9-cube.sh
#
# Produces d3d9-cube-x86.exe (i386 PE) and copies it into
# app/Madeira/i386-windows/ so the IPA build picks it up.  Imports must be
# exactly kernel32 + user32 + d3d9, all Wine-supplied; the script asserts it.
