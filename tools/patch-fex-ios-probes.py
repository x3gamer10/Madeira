"""Guard two FEX diagnostic probes that do not compile for the iOS static libs.

FEX 0f8edf8 (ios-port-2607), as pinned by upstream Madeira:

- Core.cpp: the [ffs-bypass] and [cb-entry] blocks in CompileBlock sit after
  the #endif that closes the FEX_IOS_HOST section, but the buffers they read
  (IosFfsBypassLog, IosCbEntryLog) are declared only inside it.
- Arm64.cpp: the [caspal128] probe calls VirtualQuery with a
  MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION, which exist on the ARM64EC/PE target only.

Both only print logs, so wrap them in the guard their declarations live under.

- Core.cpp also calls rpm_cas_snapshot_take, which is defined in the rpmalloc
  fork -- built only with ENABLE_FEX_ALLOCATOR, which upstream's own
  build/fex-ios/build.sh turns off -- so the app link fails on it. Turn the
  declaration into a weak definition returning 0 ("no snapshot"); rpmalloc's
  strong definition still wins whenever it is linked.
Idempotent; fails by name if the anchors move (the pin changed).

Run from the repository root.
