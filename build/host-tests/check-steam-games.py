"""Steam games in the library (app/Madeira/SteamGames.swift), on the host.

1. Swift: compiles the production SteamGamesRules with Madeira Dock's production
   discovery (MadeiraDock.games / game(manifest:), sliced as in
   check-dock-contract.py, and SteamKeyValues.swift) and checks, on a synthetic
   drive_c laid out as Steam's client writes it, that installed and partly
   installed games are found, plus the section, search, Play-blocker and
   artwork rules, and the merge of installed and owned games (owned games come
   from the production SteamOwnedGame and SteamAppInfo).
2. Source checks: the section uses Dock's discovery and Dock's launch path
   only (no environment, sign-in transfer, token or Wine call of its own), no
   program-name list, no account data in a log line, wired into the library,
   built by the Xcode project.

Synthetic data only: no Steam, Wine or credentials.
