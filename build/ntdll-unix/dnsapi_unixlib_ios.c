 * iOS unix side for dlls/dnsapi/libresolv.c.
 *
 * dnsapi.dll had no unix side on this port, so the unixlib loader bound its
 * module to the generic stub table, whose every entry returns
 * STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. DnsQuery_* failed, and so did DnsQueryConfig's DNS
 * server list, which iphlpapi's GetAdaptersAddresses asks for: every call of
 * it returned 0xc00000bb (as a Win32 error) even with the NSI interface and
 * address tables served. Valve's Windows client asserts on exactly that
 * ("CalcUnIPThisBox - GetAdaptersAddresses returned -1073741637") in a
 * Madeira Dock session.
 *
 * Same shape as dwrite_freetype_ios.c: keep upstream's file as the
 * implementation and rewrite only the way it reaches its host library.
 * Upstream dlls/dnsapi/libresolv.c calls res_init()/res_query() and touches
 * `_res` directly, expecting configure to have linked -lresolv. Linking
 * -lresolv here would add a dependency to the app's final link, which this
 * build stage does not own, so the three things it uses are resolved at first
 * use out of /usr/lib/libresolv.9.dylib with dlopen/dlsym (a system library,
 * which an iOS sandbox may dlopen).
 *
 * Every one of those has a fallback that returns a failure rather than
 * faulting: with no resolver library DnsQuery_A reports
 * DNS_ERROR_RCODE_SERVER_FAILURE (map_h_errno(TRY_AGAIN)) and the server list
 * comes back empty (DNS_ERROR_NO_DNS_SERVERS), both normal, documented
 * outcomes for a Windows program.
 *
 * Apple spellings this file relies on (iPhoneOS SDK <resolv.h>):
 *   res_init  -> res_9_init,  res_ninit -> res_9_ninit
 *   res_query -> res_9_query, res_nquery -> res_9_nquery
 *   __res_state (both the struct tag and the per-thread accessor)
 *                              -> __res_9_state
 * The _n* forms take the state explicitly and report through
 * state->res_h_errno, so they are preferred: they keep this file off the
 * process-global `_res`/`h_errno` symbols entirely.
 *
 * virtual_ios.c binds this table for dnsapi.dll; MADEIRA_DNSAPI_UNIXLIB=0
 * keeps the stub table as before.
