/* Taken from github.com/bahacan16/madeira-bcd at 563ac693 (125hz's WoW64 tree, commit
 * 035eed4e46 "ntdll iOS: 32-bit unix sides for audio, networking and crypto"), where
 * Saints Row 2 plays on an iPhone 17. Replaces upstream's driver, which played only
 * the first two channels, resampled by nearest sample and had no limiter. Same
 * 37-entry mmdevapi table as the pinned wine/dlls/mmdevapi/unixlib.h. */
/*
 * audio_null_ios.c — minimal Wine audio "null" driver for iOS Madeira.
 *
 * Wine's mmdevapi loads a `wine<name>.drv` PE plus a unix-side function
 * table (37 entries). On Linux/macOS the unix table is a separate .so.
 * On iOS we statically link the table into Madeira.app — this file is
 * that table for "ios" / "coreaudio".
 *
 * Behaviour: ONE fake render endpoint, accepts buffer submissions and
 * discards, advances IAudioClock at real-time based on
 * mach_absolute_time. Enough to let FMOD's clock-driven timing
 * advance (rhythm games like Thumper gate splash→title on intro
 * music completing — this is what makes that work).
 *
 * 2026-07-05 TIER-2: REAL AUDIO OUTPUT via a RemoteIO AudioUnit.
 * WASAPI render semantics map onto a lock-free ring buffer:
 *   get_render_buffer  -> contiguous scratch pointer
 *   release_render_buffer -> copy scratch into the ring, advance write_pos
 *   RemoteIO render callback (Core Audio real-time thread — touches ONLY
 *   the ring + atomics, never Wine) -> copy ring to hardware, advance
 *   play_pos; underrun plays silence
 *   get_current_padding -> write_pos - play_pos
 *   get_position        -> play_pos (frames actually consumed)
 *   timer_loop          -> Wine thread; signals the client event per period
 * If AudioUnit setup fails (no session, etc.) the driver degrades to the
 * Tier-1 wall-clock null behaviour so game timing never breaks.
 * AVAudioSession activation happens app-side (WineProcessBridge.m).

 * XAudio2 says so explicitly: voices sum without clamping and it is the
 * endpoint's job to cope.  The device census caught a title's mastering voice
 * running at a peak of 7.99 -- +18 dB over full scale -- and this driver was
 * hard-clipping every one of those samples to 1.0.  Clipping a signal that is
 * eight times too big does not make it quieter, it replaces it with a square
 * wave: that is the "horrible static" the device reported, and it appeared in
 * gameplay and cutscenes (many voices summed) while the menu (one quiet
 * voice) sounded fine.
 *
 * Windows does not clip here either; its shared-mode engine runs a limiter
 * that rides the gain down.  So does this.  Per block: find the block's peak
 * BEFORE applying anything, move an envelope follower (instant attack, ~250 ms
 * release), derive gain = min(1, 0.98/envelope), and ramp linearly from the
 * previous block's gain to this one's across the block so the gain changes do
 * not themselves become zipper noise.  The hard clamp stays as a safety net
 * for the one block a transient can outrun, where it now trims a fraction of
 * a dB instead of 18.
 *
 * Cost: one max-scan and one multiply per sample, on a buffer that is already

/* MADEIRA (WOW64_DESIGN.md 3, invariants 1 and 2): render-buffer ownership.
 *
 * render_scratch is the ONE buffer this driver hands back to its client:
 * get_render_buffer returns it and the application writes its samples
 * straight into it (release_render_buffer then copies it into the ring).
 * Invariant 1 says any pointer guest code can observe is a guest address, so
 * for a 32-bit client that buffer MUST live inside that process's
 * [B, B+4G) window.  A calloc() pointer is ordinary host furniture far above
 * 4 GB: publishing it would truncate to an unrelated low address and the
 * first sample the game wrote would land somewhere random in the window.
 *
 * So when the calling process has a window, reserve the scratch with a GUEST
 * ceiling -- zero_bits = 1 gives limit 0x7fffffff, which virtual_ios.c's
 * ios_wow_translate_limits() turns into [B+floor, B+0x7fffffff] -- and refuse
 * loudly if the result somehow lands outside the window.  With no window
 * (every 64-bit caller) this is byte-for-byte the calloc() path that has
 * always been here.
 *
 * The ring and the AudioUnit are untouched: they are only ever read by the
 * unix side and the Core Audio RT thread, which speak host addresses.

 * it is "success, and the answer is whatever was already on the caller's
 * stack".  That cost a whole core.
 *
 * mmdevapi's DriverProc (wine/dlls/mmdevapi/main.c, DRV_LOAD) starts a
 * notify_thread whenever midi_init leaves its *err at DRV_SUCCESS, and that
 * thread is `while (1) { midi_notify_wait; if (quit) break; ... }`.
 * midi_notify_wait is defined to BLOCK until a notification arrives or the
 * driver is released -- winecoreaudio.drv and winealsa.drv both sit on a
 * condition variable in it.  A stub that returns instantly without setting
 * *quit turns that loop into a spin: in the reference trace the thread
 * "mmdevapi_midi_notify" held 96.7 % of a core for the whole session inside
 * the 31-byte guest loop at mmdevapi.dll+0xca4c, with the movie it was meant
 * to be playing stalled behind it.
 *
 * So each entry point now answers for itself:
 *   midi_init        -> DRV_FAILURE, so DRV_LOAD fails and the thread is
 *                       never created (winmm then reports no MIDI devices,
 *                       which is the truth; waveOut does not come through
 *                       here -- mmdevapi exports no wodMessage).
 *   midi_notify_wait -> quit = TRUE, so even a thread that does exist leaves
 *                       its loop on the first turn instead of spinning.
 *   mid/mod/aux msg  -> MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED and send_notify = FALSE.

/* ================= MADEIRA: the 32-bit (WoW64) table =================
 *
 * WOW64_DESIGN.md 2/3 (invariant 2) and 7.10 item 1.  A 32-bit mmdevapi.dll
 * builds its argument blocks with 4-byte pointers and 4-byte HANDLEs, so the
 * table above would read every field after the first pointer at the wrong
 * offset.  `args` itself is already a HOST pointer -- the WoW64 module
 * converts that one outer pointer -- but every pointer EMBEDDED in the block
 * is still a GUEST address and needs + B before it is dereferenced, which is
 * what ios_wow_host_ptr() does (NULL-preserving); ios_wow_guest_ptr32()
 * writes one back.  Handles, stream handles, sizes, flags and enums are
 * never offset (invariant 4).
 *
 * Shape mirrors upstream's drivers (dlls/winecoreaudio.drv/coreaudio.c,
 * dlls/winealsa.drv/alsa.c): one thunk per call that carries a pointer, and
 * the 64-bit entry shared directly wherever the two layouts are identical
 * (a stream_handle is UINT64 and 8-byte aligned on i386 too) or the entry
 * ignores `args` entirely.  The ORDER is enum unix_funcs from
 * wine/dlls/mmdevapi/unixlib.h, the same order as the table above.
 *
 * Buffer contract: get_render_buffer is the only call that hands the client a
 * pointer, and its buffer is allocated inside the guest window by
 * ios_audio_alloc_scratch(); the thunk refuses to publish anything that is
 * not in the window.
