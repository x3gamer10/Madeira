// The starting screen of a game started through Madeira Dock (docs/MADEIRA_DOCK.md,
// "Starting screen"). A Dock start is a desktop session: explorer's virtual desktop
// runs the Dock host. The desktop's first GDI frame (explorer's own windows, the
// host's console window) used to end the starting screen, so the user watched the
// Wine desktop instead of the game. The starting screen now stays, with the Dock's
// status, until a window of the started game is up; a window that may need an answer
// reveals the desktop, and Show desktop reveals it on request.
//
// Which window is which comes from Winios.m's census (the owning program of every
// top-level window, with its executable path) and is decided by WHERE that program
// lives on drive C, never by its name:
//   - C:\windows\ holds Wine's own programs (shell, services, console hosts,
//     msiexec) and the Dock host: never the game;
//   - the Steam client's folder, outside its steamapps library, holds Valve's
//     client programs: a dialog of theirs may need the user;
//   - any other program is the game (or its own launcher) once the Dock host has
//     started. Before that, the game's one-time installs run from the batch, and a
//     window first shown then is an installer's: never the game, and a dialog of
//     theirs may need the user.
// Log tag: [steam-launch-view] (scene names, window sizes and owner classes only).
