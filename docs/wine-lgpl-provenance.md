# Wine fork: LGPL branch provenance (DRAFT 2026-09-16, for review)

**Problem.** The fork on `wine` HEAD (branch used by the superproject)
applied LGPL-2.1 section 3 to convert the whole copy to GPL-3.0-or-later
(commit 0224441925d). That conversion is irreversible for that copy and
makes upstream Wine authors' code GPL-only there, so no exception for
Apple's proprietary converter can attach to it.

**Solution prepared.** Branch `madeira-lgpl` in the `wine` repository,
built as: upstream tag `wine-11.4` + the 51 Madeira commits below
cherry-picked in order with `-x` (skipping only the conversion commit) +
one commit adding LGPL `LICENSE-MADEIRA.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
All 51 applied without conflict. ADOPTED 2026-09-16: the wine submodule now points at `madeira-lgpl`
(a1e4a040484). A diff against the retired GPL branch differs only in
licence-notice lines (22629 lines swapped, equal counts, no code change).

**Authorship.** Every one of the 51 commits carries the author
`Will Faust <willtechnoduck@gmail.com>`. Git authorship is evidence of
origin, not proof of ownership. OWNERSHIP CONFIRMATION: pending an explicit
statement by the author that no patch below was adapted from third-party
code except as noted (requested 2026-09-16):
- `dlls/wineios.drv/coreaudio.c`, `coremidi.c`, `coreaudio.h`, `unixlib.h`
  derive from upstream Wine's `winecoreaudio.drv` (Copyright CodeWeavers,
  Huw Davies) and keep those notices. Their licence is upstream's LGPL.
- Notice-line touches outside the conversion commit: 8 lines across the
  series (headers copied when files were derived); none change a licence.

**Baseline:** wine-11.4 (upstream). **Commits (oldest first):**
