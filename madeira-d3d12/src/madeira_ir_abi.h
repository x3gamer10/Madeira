/* Shared ABI between the ARM64EC D3D12 runtime and the native shader-converter
 * service, crossed exactly once per pipeline creation via winemetal's unix call.
 *
 * Why this lives in its own header rather than inside either side: the two ends
 * are compiled by different toolchains (mingw ARM64EC PE, and Apple clang for
 * the Mach-O side), so a struct described twice would drift silently and the
 * first symptom would be a misread field rather than a build error.
 *
 * Every field is fixed-width and the struct is explicitly padded, because the
 * two compilers only agree on layout if nothing is left to their discretion.
 *
 * Pointers cross as uint64_t. Both sides are 64-bit and share one address
 * space, but writing them as pointers would make the layout depend on each
 * compiler's pointer type, which is exactly what this header exists to avoid. */
